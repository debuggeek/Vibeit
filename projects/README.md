# Projects Directory

This directory contains various vibe-related projects for testing and experimentation.

## Purpose

Each subdirectory in this folder represents a standalone project designed to test different vibes, features, or concepts. These projects serve as experimental playgrounds and test beds for the Vibeit ecosystem.

## Structure

```
projects/
├── project-name-1/       # Description of project 1
├── project-name-2/       # Description of project 2
└── ...                   # Additional projects
```

## Adding a New Project

To add a new project to this directory:

1. Create a new subdirectory with a descriptive name
2. Include a README.md in the project directory explaining its purpose
3. Add any necessary configuration files
4. Document the project in the main repository README.md

## Guidelines

- Each project should be self-contained
- Include clear documentation for each project
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep projects focused on specific testing goals or vibes
